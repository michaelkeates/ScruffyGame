Hammurabi is a frontend WinForm application built using C# and based on the original text-based Hamurabi that was first developed under the name of King Sumeria or The Sumer Game by Doug Dyment in 1968. Hammurabi is a WinForm game with a graphical user interface of land and resource management. This was developed for an assigment for the University of South Wales.

<h2 align="left">Description</h1>

I was tasked with recreating the Hamurabi game with UI components for one of my assigments set by the university. The Graphical User Interface was created from scratch using Adobe Photoshop. I was also tasked with displaying a sorted view of the 10 years in a chart as well as publishing the finished product within a Windows Installer.

<h3 align="left">Game Rules</h3>
<ul>
<li>The game lasts 10 years, with a year being one turn</li>
<li>Each year, enter how many bushels of grain to allocate to buying (or selling) acres of land, feeding your population, and planting crops for the next year.</li>
<li>Each acre of land requires one bushel of grain to plant seeds.</li>
<li>The price of each acre of land fluctuates from 17 bushels per acre to 26 bushels.</li>
<li>If the conditions in your country ever become bad enough, the people will overthrow you and you won't finish your 10 year term.</li>
<li>If you make it to the 11th year, your rule will be evaluated and you'll be ranked against great figures in history.</li>
</ul>

<h3 align="left">Basic Strategy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Start with trying to feed all, or most, of your population 20 bushels of grain per person.</li>
<li>Try to plant seeds on all of your land, assuming you have enough people and enough grain.</li>
<li>Last, if you have grain remaining, you might spend some buying additional acres of land, especially if the price is right. If you didn't have enough grain for food and seed, you may need to sell some of your land, hopefully, at a good price.</li>
</ul>
