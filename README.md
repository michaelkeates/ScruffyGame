I was tasked by the University of South Wales for the Software Development Module in Year 1 of studying HND to produce an animated computer game of choice. The task was to implement basic animation and keyboard controls, collision detection, features and functions in separated methods, scoring system along with loading and saving high scores among others.

<h2 align="left">Description</h1>

<h3 align="left">Game Rules</h3>
<ul>
<li>Get “Scruff” from point A to point B within the time limit otherwise the player loses the game.</li>
<li>The player will lose the game if “Scruff” loses all its health.</li>
<li>Scruff can lose health by going into fire, water, asteroid or eagle lander.</li>
<li>The more sausages that “Scruff” eats (collects) the more points the player will have.</li>
<li>Each sausage will give “Scruff” some more health.</li>
<li>Each sausage is worth 2 points towards the final score.</li>
<li>Each sausage also will make “Scruff” ‘heavier’ which in turn will make “Scruff” slower in manoeuvrability.</li>
<li>“Scruff” will randomly ‘poo’ which will make her ‘lighter’ and will move faster again.</li>
</ul>

I created a side scrolling game along with creating the graphical user interface from scratch using Adobe Photoshop. I implemented a way for PNG images to have transparency within the program such as the Health bar in the top right of the game screen. This however had a hit on performance and Windows Form was never designed to produce a program such like this. In the future I would like to recreate this using the Unreal Game Engine and have a mobile version.
